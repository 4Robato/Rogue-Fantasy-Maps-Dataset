# Rogue Fantasy Maps Dataset

This repository contains a collection of pixel maps generated using a combination of Perlin and Simplex noises techniques. They come in 3 sizes and each size contains 1500 PNG images.

## Folder Structure

The dataset is organized into three folders based on the size of the pixel maps:

* **LARGE:** (17.3 MB) Contains maps with dimensions 300x200 pixels.
* **MEDIUM:** (5.35 MB) Contains maps with dimensions 180x120 pixels.
* **SMALL:** (2.79 MB) Contains maps with dimensions 120x80 pixels.

## Data Format

All pixel maps in this dataset are stored as `.png` image files.

## License

This dataset is made available under the **Attribution 4.0 International** (CC-BY). See the `LICENSE` file for more details.


## How to Use

1.  **Download the repository:** You can clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/4Robato/Rogue-Fantasy-Maps-Dataset.git
    ```

2.  **Choose the size of the maps:** There's 3 folders (LARGE, MEDIUM and SMALL) each containing a different map size.

## Motivation

I've been learning Machine Learning and I needed an image dataset and at the same time I've been working on a game (which might never release!) that generates a map before you start playing using a combination of Perlin and Simplex noises.

So I decided to create my own dataset to practice! And I thought the community could appreciate it too.
